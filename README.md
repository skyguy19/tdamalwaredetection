## Datasets

Two malware datasets are used. Check the links below

## Techniques

We explore 3 TDA techniques: Persistent diagrams, Mapper, and Tomato.
In unsupervised learning, TDA techniques generated clusters allowing
to pinpoint malware clusters, even identifying zero-day malware behaviors.

For supervised learning, TDA techniques are used as feature extractor and 
fed to ML techniques such as xgboost, lightgbm, random forest, and decision tree.  


## Performance

We record various metrics:

(1) false positive rate, detection rate, accuracy, precision, f-score, etc.

(2) training time, inference time, training memory usage, inference memory usage, etc.
